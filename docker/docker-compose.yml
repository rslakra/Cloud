# This 'docker-compose.yml' file tells Docker to do the following:
#
# 1. Pull the image, which is already uploaded in the 'rlakradocker/repository:dNames' registry.
# 2. Run 3 instances of that image as a service called names, limiting each one to use, 
#    at most, 10% of a single core of CPU time (this could also be e.g. “1.5” to 
#    mean 1 and half core for each), and 50MB of RAM.
#
# 3. Immediately restart containers if one fails.
# 4. Map port 8080 on the host to web’s port 8080.
# 5. Instruct web’s containers to share port 8080 via a load-balanced network called webnet.
#    (Internally, the containers themselves publish to web’s port 80 at an ephemeral port.)
# 6. Define the webnet network with the default settings (which is a load-balanced overlay network).
